### Data-Driven Strategy for Used Car Sales 
This project provides our client (AutoMaster) with a strategic, data-driven approach to optimizing used car sales. By leveraging web scraping and advanced data analysis, we identify market trends, segment customers, and refine pricing strategies to enhance profitability and competitive positioning.

Additionally, we have developed a ***predictive pricing model*** that estimates the optimal market price of a vehicle based on key attributes such as brand, model, mileage, horsepower, and year of manufacture. This enables our client to make data-informed pricing decisions, maximizing returns and aligning listings with real market demand.
