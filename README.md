# Project goal 

### Data-Driven Strategy for Used Car Sales 
In this project, we assumed the role of data analysts and data scientists to develop a strategic solution for optimizing used car sales. Using real-world data from second-hand car listings in Spain, we built a predictive pricing model with Azure ML Automated to estimate the optimal market price of a vehicle based on key attributes such as brand, model, mileage, horsepower, and year of manufacture.

Additionally, we conducted data extraction, preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and visualization to provide valuable insights into market trends and pricing strategies.
