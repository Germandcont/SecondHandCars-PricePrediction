#  Used Car Price Prediction & Market Analysis  ***(With Azure ML Studio, Python and Power BI)***

### Project goal 
In this project, we assumed the role of Data Analysts and Data Scientists to develop a strategic solution for optimizing used car sales. Using real-world data from second-hand car listings in Spain, we built a predictive pricing model with Azure ML Automated to estimate the optimal market price of a vehicle based on key attributes such as brand, model, mileage, horsepower, and year of manufacture.

Additionally, we conducted data extraction, preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and visualization to provide valuable insights into market trends and pricing strategies.


### Key Project Components:
- Predictive Pricing Model â€“ Developed using Azure ML Automated, estimating vehicle prices based on historical market data.
- Real-World Data Collection â€“ Extracted actual used car listings from Spain through web scraping.
- ETL & Data Preprocessing â€“ Cleaned and transformed raw data for accurate analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Identified key insights and pricing patterns.
- Power BI Dashboard â€“ Designed interactive visualizations to support strategic decision-making.
